This lab is aimed at getting you familiar with using the ModelSim simulator. The circuits you will be simulating should be familiar to you from your digital logic course.

Instructions

Write a VHDL program consisting of a single entity whose architecture is a single process that implements an XOR gate. That is, a circuit which behaves as specified in the following truth table. You should implement your architecture as a single process.
